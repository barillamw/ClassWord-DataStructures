# Overview
Class projects for Object Oriented Programming Lecture. Gave exposure to a variety of differnet data structures and how they could be utilized to accomplish a a multitude of tasks. 

## What I Learned 
Learning about all of the differnet data structures was very interesting and I enjoyed looking into how each of them could be used for a specific outcome. From linked lists to hash tables and even Maps. I learned that I enjoy taking tasks and exploring differnet ways to optimize the solution. 

To run test cases, we would use a CI/CD pipeline including Travis-CI. This is the first time I have worked with jenkins, but it seems like a useful tool that has uncountable use cases including test cases, security and quality assurance. Looking forwrad to seeing how this can be used in future projects that I complete.

## ece309-fall18-mbarill

### Revision History ###
* **Hw 2:** Duplicated repsoitory, edited Readme File, Linked Travis CI, Ran tests successfully, created hw2.cpp to meet specs, Passed test as expected.
* **HW 3:** Built a List with a reverse iterator.
* **HW 4:** Created a polymorphic list from Homework 3. 
* **HW 5:** Implement the IntegerSet class with the proper member functions and create the InArray with the proper operators and member functions
* **HW6:** Test Hash Function to find the quality of the function. Create a Hash Table iterator that can run the proper test code.
* **HW8:** Create Max-Heap Algorithm to return the top three of the list.
* **HW10:** Creat an infinity integer class that can run operations on +infinity and -infinity. Modify the Shortest Path on a Graph function to utilize a Min Heap instead of a linear iterator.
* **HW11:** Put all homework assignments into an ece309 namespace.
